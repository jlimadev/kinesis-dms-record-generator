## Summary

> This is  simple CLI, to help developers simulate the records that Amazon DMS sends to
> a kinesis stream, when running Migration Tasks.

## The problem

> When developers are working with DMS + Kinesis, it's very difficult to simulate the stream locally,
> therefore, developer's productivity is impaired. This tool aims in improving the developer experience and productivity

## The solution

> By using tools such as [Data Grip](https://www.jetbrains.com/datagrip/), the developer can right-click the table,
> and export the table content to a JSON File. This tool will feed from this JSON file,
> and it will automatically generate the Kinesis Record, and use the aws-cli to put the records in the stream

# Dependencies

Before using this tool, you must have the following tools configured in your machine

- [aws cli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- [Localstack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack) (with kinesis enabled)

# Pattern on filenames

All the files inside the folder should follow the following pattern.

```bash
loadOrder.schema.table.json
```

For example

```bash
1.OT.CUSTOMER.json
2.OT.PRODUCTS.json
```

The bigger the load-order, first it will be loaded, following the same patter from [Amazon DMS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Tasks.CustomizingTasks.TableMapping.SelectionTransformation.Selections.html).

For the example files, the order will be:
```bash
2.OT.PRODUCTS.json
1.OT.CUSTOMER.json
```

The JSON can have a single record, or an array of records, for example:

```json
[
  {
    "ID": 1,
    "NAME": "Joselito Silva"
  }
]
```

This JSON file will generate the following Kinesis Record

```json
{
  "data": {
    "ID": 1,
    "NAME": "Joselito Silva"
  },
  "metadata": {
    "timestamp": "2021-02-21T23:02:36.5680Z",
    "record-type": "data",
    "operation": "load",
    "partition-key-type": "primary-key",
    "schema-name": "OT",
    "table-name": "CUSTOMER"
  }
}
```

# CLI Options

| Option | Description  | Required  | Default  |
| ------- | --- | --- | --- |
| -d, --directory <value> | The folder where the JSON files are located | Yes | |
| -s, --stream-name <value> | The name of the kinesis stream | Yes | |
| -p, --partition-key <value> | The partition key | No | 1 |
| -e, --localstack-endpoint <value> | The localstack endpoint | No | http://localhost:4566 |
| -o, --operation <value> | The operation* name you want to simulate | No | LOAD |
| -b, --batch-size <value> | batch-size for batch processing | No | 1 |

- *Valid operations: LOAD, INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE
- *Valid batch sizes: 1 to 500 [(AWS limits)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/kinesis/put-records.html)
  
The cli will load all files inside the **files** folder, and load them to the kinesis stream
_By default it will load one by one but you can also add the --batch-size <value> to put multiple records in batches_

# Running as bin

```bash
npx dms-kinesis-gen -d C:/Users/my-user/Documents/cdc-files -s my-stream-name
```

or install it globally with

```bash
npm i -g dms-kinesis-gen
```

And then use the command

```bash
dms-kinesis-gen -d C:/Users/my-user/Documents/cdc-files -s my-stream-name
```
